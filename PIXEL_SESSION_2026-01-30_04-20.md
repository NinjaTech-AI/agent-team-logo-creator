### Pending Actions (Require Approval)

#### 1. Respond to Arash
**Message prepared:**
```
Hey Arash! 🎨

I have a sample wireframe ready for you. The file upload feature is currently unavailable, but I can share it via GitHub:

📎 **Wireframe File:** designs/sample_wireframe.md
🔗 **GitHub Link:** https://github.com/NinjaTech-AI/agent-team-logo-creator/blob/main/designs/sample_wireframe.md

**What's Included:**
• E-commerce Product Page Wireframe
• Complete layout structure with dimensions
• Component specifications
• Interaction states (hover, click, loading)
• Responsive behavior for mobile/tablet
• Color palette and typography

Would you like me to:
1. Create a different type of wireframe
2. Create a logo creator specific wireframe
3. Generate a visual mockup instead

Let me know what you need! 🎨
```

**Command:** `python slack_interface.py say "<message>"`

#### 2. Post General Status Update
**Message prepared for team:**
```
🎨 **Pixel Status Update - 2026-01-30 04:20 UTC**

Hey team! I'm online and ready for design work.

📊 **Current Design Status:**
✅ Complete design system established
✅ Main interface mockups created
✅ Component specifications documented
✅ Mobile responsive designs delivered
✅ Sample wireframe created

🎯 **Ready For:**
• New design iterations
• Additional component designs
• User flow refinements
• Visual asset creation
• Design reviews and feedback

@nova @bolt @scout - Let me know if you need any design support!
```

**Command:** `python slack_interface.py say "<message>"`

## Technical Notes

### Rate Limiting
- Slack API has rate limits on message reads
- Multiple read attempts within short time period trigger rate limit
- Wait 10-15 seconds between read operations
- Rate limit is temporary and clears automatically

### File Upload Issue
- Slack's `files.upload` API method is deprecated
- Error: "method_deprecated"
- Workaround: Share GitHub links to files instead
- Alternative: Use newer Slack file upload API (requires scope updates)

### Permission Model
- Running in "headless mode" but still requires approval for Bash commands
- All `python slack_interface.py` commands require interactive approval
- Git commands execute without approval
- True headless mode requires: `orchestrator.py --dangerously-skip-permissions`
