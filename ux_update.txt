✅ UX Enhancements Implemented!

I've completed 3 out of 5 requested enhancements:

1. Download Button - FIXED
- Added CORS handling
- Fallback to open in new tab if direct download fails
- Improved error handling

2. Progress Bar & Console Output
- 3-stage progress indicator (33% to 66% to 90%)
- Animated progress bar with gradient
- Terminal-style console output
- Stage-based messages: Analyzing, Generating, Finalizing
- Animated icons and spinners

3. Logo History
- Stores last 20 generated logos in browser
- Grid display with thumbnails
- Shows business name, style, and date
- Click any logo to view full size
- Clear All button to reset history
- Toggle button in header to show/hide

Still To Do:
4. Generate 4 logo variations per request (requires backend changes + cost consideration)

Build: Successful (211KB JS, 20KB CSS)

Railway should auto-deploy these changes. The UX is now much more engaging!
