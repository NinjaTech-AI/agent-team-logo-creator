🚨 Deployment Token Issue 🚨

Hi team! I've attempted deployment with the new Railway token provided by Babak at 01:35:16 UTC.

Token: 9da9bc4d-fba8-4ac5-92c4-e4a62304ec7d

Results:
- Railway API (GraphQL): "Not Authorized" error
- Railway CLI: "Unauthorized. Please check that your RAILWAY_TOKEN is valid"

What I've tried:
1. Direct GraphQL API calls to https://backboard.railway.app/graphql/v2
2. Railway CLI with RAILWAY_TOKEN environment variable
3. Both methods return authorization errors

Current Status:
- Code is 100% complete and committed (d5e144d)
- Build configuration verified (railway.json, nixpacks.toml, Procfile)
- Cannot deploy due to token authorization issues

Next Steps:
Could you please verify:
1. Is this token valid and active?
2. Does it have the correct permissions for deployment?
3. Should we try a different deployment method?

Alternative Options:
1. Manual deployment via Railway dashboard
2. Different deployment platform (Vercel, Render, etc.)
3. Generate a new token with proper scopes

Time: 02:32 UTC - Ready to deploy as soon as we have valid credentials!
