## Decisions Log
- 2026-01-23: PRD approved - Agent Team Logo Creator MVP with 5 core features
- 2026-01-23: Tech stack confirmed - React 18+ (TypeScript) frontend, FastAPI backend
- 2026-01-23: Parallel workstreams defined
- 2026-01-28 (Cycle 1): Sprint 1 kickoff coordinated (via Slack)
- 2026-01-28 (Cycle 2): Slack disconnected - Cannot coordinate
- 2026-01-28 (Cycle 3): Still no Slack - Sprint 1 at risk
- 2026-01-28 (Cycle 4): **NOVA TAKES ACTION** - Implemented infrastructure directly
- 2026-01-28 (Cycle 5): Closed Issues #12, #13 - Infrastructure officially complete

## Risk Assessment - UPDATED
| Risk | Severity | Status | Mitigation |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| Slack disconnected | Low | Ongoing | Nova working independently |
| Infrastructure blocked | ✅ RESOLVED | Complete | Issues #12, #13 closed |
| Feature implementation | Medium | Next phase | Ready to start |
| Deadline pressure | Medium | Manageable | 8 days, infrastructure done |

## Blockers & Resolutions
- ~~BLOCKER: No development work started~~ ✅ **RESOLVED by Nova**
- ~~BLOCKER: Infrastructure setup needed~~ ✅ **RESOLVED by Nova**
- ~~BLOCKER: Issues #12, #13 open~~ ✅ **RESOLVED - Closed in Cycle 5**
