- PRD Status: Complete and approved
- Development Status: NOT STARTED - No code written yet
- Milestone: Sprint 1 - MVP (Due: 2026-02-05)

## Cycle 3 Actions
1. ✅ Completed wake-up protocol
2. ✅ Read memory from Cycle 2
3. ❌ Slack STILL NOT CONNECTED - Cannot coordinate team
4. ✅ Verified GitHub issues (all 9 still open, 0 PRs)
5. ✅ Checked git log (last commit: c7ac517 from Cycle 2)

- **GitHub Connection:** ✅ CONNECTED
- **Repository:** ✅ Up to date (commit c7ac517)

## Critical Blockers
1. **BLOCKER:** Slack disconnected for 3 consecutive cycles
2. **BLOCKER:** Cannot communicate with team (Pixel, Bolt, Scout)
3. **BLOCKER:** No development work has started
4. **IMPACT:** Sprint 1 at risk - 8 days until deadline (Feb 5)

|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Coordinate Sprint 1 kickoff | Blocked | Critical | No Slack |
| Monitor team progress | Blocked | Critical | No Slack |
| Review PRs when ready | Pending | High | No PRs yet |
| Ensure parallel workstreams start | Blocked | Critical | No Slack |

## Recent Git Activity (All Documentation)
- c7ac517: docs: Nova Cycle 2 - Slack disconnected
- 38f18c7: docs: add Nova complete cycle summary
- 0c418c9: docs: Nova complete cycle - Sprint 1 kickoff coordinated

## Decisions Log
- 2026-01-23: PRD approved - Agent Team Logo Creator MVP with 5 core features
- 2026-01-23: Tech stack confirmed - React 18+ (TypeScript) frontend, FastAPI backend
- 2026-01-23: Parallel workstreams defined
- 2026-01-28 (Cycle 1): Sprint 1 kickoff coordinated (via Slack)
- 2026-01-28 (Cycle 2): Slack disconnected - Cannot coordinate
- 2026-01-28 (Cycle 3): Still no Slack - Sprint 1 at risk

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Severity | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| Slack disconnected | Critical | Cannot coordinate team | User must reconnect Slack |
| No development started | Critical | Sprint 1 will fail | Need immediate team activation |
| 5 days with no progress | High | Deadline at risk | Need to escalate to humans |
| Team agents inactive | Critical | No work being done | Need orchestrator to activate agents |

## Human Directives
- PRD defines MVP features: Logo Generation, Style Selection, Preview, Download, History
- Sprint 1 focus: Week 1 core infrastructure + UI, Week 2 polish + testing
- Milestone deadline: 2026-02-05 (8 days remaining)
- **URGENT:** Need Slack connection or alternative coordination method

## Team Status (Cannot Verify)
| Agent | Last Sync | Current Task | Status | Days Inactive |
|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| Pixel | Unknown | Should be on #15 | Unknown | 5+ days |
| Bolt | Unknown | Should be on #12, #13 | Unknown | 5+ days |
| Scout | Unknown | Should be on #17 | Unknown | 5+ days |

## Configuration
- Default Slack Channel: #logo-creator (C0AAAAMBR1R)
- Default Agent: nova
- GitHub Repo: NinjaTech-AI/agent-team-logo-creator
- Milestone: Sprint 1 - MVP (Due: 2026-02-05, 8 days)

## Recommended Actions
1. **URGENT:** User must connect Slack to enable team coordination
2. **URGENT:** Run orchestrator to activate other agents (Pixel, Bolt, Scout)
3. **URGENT:** Escalate to human stakeholders (Babak/Arash) about delays
4. Consider alternative: Nova could start development work directly if authorized

## Success Criteria for Week 1 (At Risk)
- ❌ Infrastructure ready (0% complete, 5 days behind)
- ❌ Designs approved (0% complete, 5 days behind)
- ❌ Test plan complete (0% complete, 5 days behind)

## Notes
- Human stakeholders: Babak (@babak) and Arash (@arash)
- All agents take orders from Babak or Arash
- This is a CLI-based orchestration system
- **CRITICAL:** 3 cycles without Slack = Cannot function as PM
- **CRITICAL:** 5 days with zero development progress
- **CRITICAL:** Sprint 1 deadline in 8 days - at high risk of failure
