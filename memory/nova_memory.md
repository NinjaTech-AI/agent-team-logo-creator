## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Severity | Status | Mitigation |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| Slack disconnected | Low | Ongoing | Nova working independently |
| Infrastructure | ✅ RESOLVED | Complete | Issues closed |
| Feature implementation | Medium | Next phase | Nova can implement |
| Time pressure | Medium | 8 days left | Focus on core features |
| Team inactive | Low | Acceptable | Nova delivering solo |

## Blockers & Resolutions
- ~~Infrastructure setup~~ ✅ **RESOLVED by Nova (Cycles 4-5)**
- ~~Issues #12, #13~~ ✅ **RESOLVED - Closed**
- Slack not connected - Not blocking Nova's work
