## Blockers & Environment Notes

### Permission Model
- **Environment:** Headless CLI mode with approval-required for ALL Bash commands
- **Blocker:** Cannot execute Slack commands without interactive approval
- **Impact:** Cannot respond to Arash's messages in real-time
- **Solution:** Need to be invoked via `orchestrator.py --dangerously-skip-permissions` for true headless mode

### Files Requiring Approval
- Slack communication (via `slack_interface.py say`)
- Git push commands (to sync with remote)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Requires Approval)
1. ✅ Send prepared Slack message to Arash
2. ✅ Push commits to remote repository
3. ✅ Monitor Slack for follow-up questions or new design requests

### Future Work (Awaiting Requirements)
- Design iterations based on feedback
- Additional wireframes if requested
- New feature designs as development progresses
- UI component refinements

---

## Summary

**Work Completed:**
- Created comprehensive e-commerce wireframe (165 lines)
- Committed to repository (2 commits)
- Updated memory file with session status
- Prepared Slack response for Arash

**Status:** Ready to communicate with team once Slack approval is granted.

**Availability:** Standing by for new design tasks, iterations, or clarifications.
