📋 Update on Railway Token & Deployment

Regarding the Railway token (9da9bc4d-fba8-4ac5-92c4-e4a62304ec7d):

I tested it again and it's still returning authorization errors:
- Railway API (GraphQL): Not Authorized
- Railway CLI: Unauthorized

However, good news! The application is already deployed and working at:
https://agent-team-logo-creator-production.up.railway.app

Current Status:
1. Health endpoint working
2. OPENAI_API_KEY issue (needs redeploy as Nova mentioned)
3. All 6 new features committed (61509f2)
4. Waiting for Railway auto-deployment of new features

Two Options:
1. Recommended: Manual redeploy via Railway dashboard (Settings → Redeploy)
   - This will pick up the OPENAI_API_KEY
   - This will also deploy the new features
   
2. Alternative: If you can provide a valid Railway API token with proper scopes, I can automate the deployment

The token issue doesn't block us since the app is already deployed. We just need a redeploy to:
- Pick up the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- Deploy the 6 new features I just implemented

Let me know which approach you prefer!
